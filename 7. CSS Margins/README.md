<h1>CSS Margin</h1>


The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
Margin - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:
<br>
margin-top<br>
margin-right<br>
margin-bottom<br>
margin-left<br>
All the margin properties can have the following values:
<br>
auto - the browser calculates the margin<br>
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.<br>
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element<br>
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element<br>
Tip: Negative values are allowed <br>
<br>
The auto Value
You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.
